### Overview

`sm-inspect-routers` management extension provides tools for inspecting device configuration of devices:

- Cisco IOS
- MikroTik RouterOS
- Ubiquiti UniFi Security Gateway

#### Setting up passwordless ssh authentication on router

##### Cisco IOS:

##### MikroTik RouterOS:

http://fajne.it/automatyzacja-backupu-routera-mikrotik.html - in polish language, short version below:

First, you need to generate ssh DSA (not RSA) key pair and install public key on all routers you plan to connect to.

```
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.serverfarmer/ssh/id_device_mikrotik
```

Now, you have 2 files:

`~/.serverfarmer/ssh/id_device_mikrotik` is the private key, and you should protect it before any unauthorized access

`~/.serverfarmer/ssh/id_device_mikrotik.pub` is the public key, and you should install it on your routers:

```
scp -P 10022 ~/.serverfarmer/ssh/id_device_mikrotik.pub admin@router.yourdomain.com:
```

Then log in to your router using ssh (authenticating with password for the last time), and import the key to your user:

```
ssh -p 10022 admin@router.yourdomain.com
[admin@router] > user ssh-keys import public-key-file=id_device_mikrotik.pub user=admin
```

##### Ubiquiti UniFi Security Gateway:

Go to Settings page in UniFi control panel, Device Authentication section in the default tab:

- enable ssh access
- change user name to "admin" (default is probably "Admin")
- add your ssh RSA public key
